<p>Nice to meet you! Like the heading says, i'm Yssabel! I am the newest resident of San Jose, California. I was born and raised in sunny San Diego and graduated with my B.S. in Biology from San Diego State in 2015.
    Now I know what you're thinking... Biology? What is she doing in a coding class! I had the same exact thought too. I worked in Immunology biotech for the past 5 years and have now moved to a company
    that actually designs the best analysis software used for immunological data analysis. So cool! That is what peaked my interest in coding and why I am here today! I want to use the skills that I learn from this class to take me from 
    an Immunologist in Biotech, to a Software Engineer/Programmer/QA/Developer in biotech. Now for some other fun things about me! I have a 6 year old Corgi named Simba who made the move up to the Bay with me.
    I also love to play Animal Crossings in the little spare time that I have now and I am a big fan of weight lifting! Hope this gave you a little more insight into who I am!
